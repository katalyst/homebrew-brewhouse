Ketchup Ale
===========

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------

Just `brew tap ketchup/ale` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install homebrew/ale/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/ketchup/homebrew-ale/master/<formula>.rb
```
